Transfer the style of an image to another image using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with PyTorch.

The model a pre-trained Net, the VGG19 Network, to extract the features of the content and style images to come up with a new design image. The style transfer method was created by leon A Gatys in this paper https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf

The below image shows on the left the content or target image and on the right the style image that is going to be transfered to the target image.
